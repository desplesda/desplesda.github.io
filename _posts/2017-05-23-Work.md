Hi! I'm Jon. I do a bunch of different stuff.

## Secret Lab

[Secret Lab](http://secretlab.com.au) is a game dev studio based in Hobart, Australia. [Paris Buttfield-Addison](http://paris.id.au) and I have been running the joint since 2008. Practically everything you see on this page was done through the company.

## Training

I run training courses and workshops about iOS development, game design, and game development with the Unity game engine.

### Live Video Training

From time to time, we run live video training in cooperation with [O'Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com), who also publish our books.

I'm currently running **one training course**.

* [Practical AI on iOS, on April 11](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/practical-ai-on-ios/0636920166290/).

All dates are in Australian time.

### In-Person Training

We frequently run [iOS developer training](https://www.secretlab.com.au/training), which have been pretty well received by attendees! 

We don't currently have any upcoming training sessions, but [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/desplesda) and you'll be notified when one's coming up!

## Open Source Software

* [Yarn Spinner](https://github.com/thesecretlab/yarnspinner)
    * Yarn Spinner is a tool for creating interactive dialogue.

## Games

* I helped on [Night in the Woods](http://nightinthewoods.com), where I wrote and supported the implementation of the [Yarn Spinner](https://github.com/thesecretlab/yarnspinner) dialogue system.

## Books

I'm a frequent author for [O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com), where I've written a number of technical books. I mostly write about mobile app development, but I'm also known to write about video games. I usually write with my colleagues, [Paris Buttfield-Addison](http://paris.id.au) and [Tim Nugent](http://lonely.coffee).
