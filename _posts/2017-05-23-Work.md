Hi! I'm Jon. I do a bunch of different stuff.

## /dev/world

I help run [/dev/world](http://devworld.com.au), Australia's oldest running Apple developer conference. /dev/world/2018 is on 26-28 August. The [call for presentations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5-40lryHLrATFtjUqHtMfuc_lCsTT0LjhQ45qOGfGNMSBxw/viewform) is open now!

## Secret Lab

[Secret Lab](http://secretlab.com.au) is a game dev studio based in Hobart, Australia. [Paris Buttfield-Addison](http://paris.id.au) and I have been running the joint since 2008. Practically everything you see on this page was done through the company.

## Training

I run training courses and workshops about iOS development, game design, and game development with the Unity game engine.

### Live Video Training

From time to time, we run live video training in cooperation with [O'Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com), who also publish our books.

I'm not currently running any training courses, but I'll update this page as new ones are announced.

In the meantime, recordings of past live training events are available through O'Reilly's [Safari Books Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/search/?query=%22Jon%20Manning%22%20OR%20%22Jonathon%20Manning%22&extended_publisher_data=true&highlight=true&is_academic_institution_account=false&source=user&include_assessments=false&include_case_studies=true&include_courses=true&include_orioles=true&include_playlists=true&formats=live%20online%20training&sort=relevance&field=authors).

### In-Person Training

We frequently run [iOS developer training](https://www.secretlab.com.au/training), which have been pretty well received by attendees! 

We don't currently have any upcoming training sessions, but [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/desplesda) and you'll be notified when one's coming up!

## Open Source Software

* [Yarn Spinner](https://github.com/thesecretlab/yarnspinner)
    * Yarn Spinner is a tool for creating interactive dialogue.

## Games

* I helped on [Night in the Woods](http://nightinthewoods.com), where I wrote and supported the implementation of the [Yarn Spinner](https://github.com/thesecretlab/yarnspinner) dialogue system.

## Speaking

I've spoken at a number of conferences; usually, ones related to game development or general programming. Here are some of the talks that have been recorded and posted publicly!

* Game Developers Conference 2018: "[Making Night in the Woods Better with Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsiu-zzDYww)"

## Books

I'm a frequent author for [O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com), where I've written a number of technical books.
